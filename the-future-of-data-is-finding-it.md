# What will your session allow people to learn, make, or do? [In 150 words or less]
As journalists, data scientists, scientist scientists, researchers, historians, entrepreneurs, civic activists, and Thomas Pikkety work with and publish "datasets", they're increasingly having the difficult challenge of finding the right data they need for analysis, even if it's already been published.

Finding open data from catalogs tend to aggregate for search, but not catalog for description (say whats inside). Certain fields (such as social science) have created their own dataset description systems but they're not well used outside them (because they're seen as oenerous). And in the meantime we swap weird datasets amongst ourselves and discuss how to use them on reddit.com/r/datasets.

There's got to be a fusion of these approaches: the best of search technology, classic library technology and data description, and community support and learning, which can drive forward the way we collectively work with and discover and use data sets in data catalogs.

How's this going to work? We're not really sure. But we're bringing in some of the smartest folks in library world, social architecture, and computer science to talk about it and have an applied hack-a-think-a-jam to put together the pieces that can start making this real.

 
# How do you see that working?
To be honest, we're not completely sure and that's the point. MozFest is one of the few places where folks from all these disparate disciplines, the users of data, the creators of data catalogs like Enigma and Socrata, librarians, and of course social software architects already come together. Each of these fields are already aware of the others, but don't have plans to work with the others. Rather than have a conference just to bring these folks together, we'll each spend a few minutes talking about the various architectures we bring and then figure out how we start to bring them closer together.

# How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?
5: Pretty good. We get intimate. We get very detailed very quickly. We (the organizers) cover our background on each of the fields in great depth for the first 30 minutes, and then turn to kind of a small group brainstorming session for the next 30 minutes.

15: Now it's a party. We'll kick things off quickly then talk with everyone in the room (mostly our ideal users of these datasets) about their needs and how to apply our various approaches together to serve their data finding needs.

50: Panel discussion. Moderated questions on cards. We're not going to be able to answer everything, but we aggregate and learn.


# What do you see as the outcome after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
Hopefully we're able to put together a working group to figure out what a prototype of this crazy librarian/computer science/open community data catalog will look like. If we can find the right folks at MozFest, we get cracking on building this crazy data future where we can all find the incredible open data published across the web in time for MozFest next year.
