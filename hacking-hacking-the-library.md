# What will your session allow people to learn, make, or do? [In 150 words or less]
How do we expect to find and organize knowledge? To make sure our data and research is discoverable, findable, and preserved? Librarians have been doing this for centuries (yeah, centuries!). It's a field dedicated to the great pursuit of "it's just Metadata" representing all human knowledge.

Librarians are a lot like scientists in that while some of them can program, the vast majority cannot, despite it being a vital skill for working with the corpora of data they'll have to work with in just a few years time; so isn't it time to equip them with those skills?

In Hacking Hack the Library, we'll map out the path to do just that, building on the work Mozilla Science Lab's done to educate scientists (so librarians can support scientists).

 
# How do you see that working?
While there have been several attempts to get librarians the basic skills of computational competency, there have yet to be any adequate aggregations of materials that are tuned to the contexts which librarians traditionally respond to. We'll spend the first part of the session running through and aggregating existing resources.

We will then spend the second hour evaluating these resources, and perform an environmental survey, discussing where we can make an even greater impact than the work already done and examine what tactics would help us promote programming literacy among the broad library community. Ideally we'd then put some of our ideas to a dry run and figure out how to establish them in a scalable way across various classes of library systems (public libraries, research libraries, university libraries, etc.).

# How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?
5: its a jam session. The organizers kick things off; quickly. Then we all get together and huddle around 1 or 2 laptops and work all together, aggregating resources for the first hour. Then for the second we discuss the ecosystem of librarians learning code, and try to diagnose what is working and what is not; where messaging and techniques simply are not working, so we can find an intervention to bridge that gap.

15: Now it's a party. We'll break into groups, aggregate, then moderate the discussion for gap filling. 

50: What glorious luck. We split into several groups, reunify, then try to put our theories to the test when we make other groups try our curricular materials. 

# What do you see as the outcome after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
We'll be aggregating resources at github.com/mozillascience/training_for_libraries, and building a series of instructional materials there as a chapterized book (breaking down the existing usable resources into lessons). Then we'll start hosting series of librarian-focused online workgroups to get those who are interested connected with one another as a kind of support group.
